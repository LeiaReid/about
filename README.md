## About

This data-driven investigative project was created in response to the end of austerity. A whole generation of British children weren't given the same oppertunities to excel because of funding barriers, compared to the generations before them. I wanted to investigate this. 

Hence the child mobility comparison. It helps show how education and welfare funding has impacted children, and the difference in disposable household income.

I've collected most of the recent Department for Education Data to provide a comprehensive picture of the British Educational system, as well speaking to experts in the field, to paint a picture of daily struggles.
